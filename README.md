# Biocomputation

Overview of the different learning algorithms and knowledge representations to be considered â€“ intelligence at the level of populations/multiple agents, individuals/agents, and within agent components
The process of natural selection starts with the selection of fittest individuals from a population. They produce offspring which inherit the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next generation. If parents have better fitness, their offspring will be better than parents and have a better chance at surviving. This process keeps on iterating and at the end, a generation with the fittest individuals will be found.

This notion can be applied for a search problem. We consider a set of solutions for a problem and select the set of best ones out of them.

Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.

Initial population
Fitness function
Selection
Crossover
Mutation

These are all encoded within the script showing different instances of mutation, crossover, and tournament selection.
